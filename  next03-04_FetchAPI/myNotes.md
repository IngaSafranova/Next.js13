1. To create a types file need to create types.d.ts file.
Create types that will be used. E.g. for users we copied user object and changes actual entries into data types.

2. To create routes to new endpoints need to create  new folder in the folder that we want to have endpoints for. E.g. in users folder for userId endpoints. Name the new folder the same as the props we will be sending in the [].Then create page.tsx file in [] folder.
3. To create fetch() functions need to create lib (library) folder and make files for each function.
